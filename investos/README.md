INTRODUCTION:
Investos is a simple website that helps users understand what kind of investor they are and how they should distribute their money across  assets.

WORKING:
User takes a short quiz, investos analyzes user’s risk tolerance, confidence, and investor persona, then suggests a mix of assets like equity, gold etc.
