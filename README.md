INTRODUCTION:
Investos is a simple website that helps users understand what kind of investor they are and how they should distribute their money across  assets.

WORKING:
User takes a short quiz, investos analyzes user’s risk tolerance, confidence, and investor persona, then suggests a mix of assets like equity, gold etc.

TECH STACK:
- Frontend: React & TypeScript
- Build: Vite
- Style: Tailwind CSS

WHAT I LEARNT:
- Building react app with typescript
- Understanding scoring engine (trait-based scoring that starts from priors and adds weights from quiz answers, then maps trait scores to a persona).
- How to translate questionnaire logic into deterministic code.
- Usage of API's and charts.
